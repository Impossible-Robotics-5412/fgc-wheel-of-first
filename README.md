# Wheel of FIRST (FGC version)

Because of the limited memory on the Arduino Nano, we have to split the list of countries in to two. Just remember to switch the list of countries every once in a while with the line `#define COUNTRIES countries_1`
in the `countries.h` file. 

A workaround probably exists, but this isn't the biggest problem with how often the wheel gets used.
